# JAVA Tic Tac Toe
Welcome if you are here, we are just some of students of school X (will be revealed if this repository gets forked 10000 times) just doing some random coding. We do not have much to say, but just a message to schools that stop using BlueJ and Notepad and switch to VS Code. Also, teach python instead of JAVA.
